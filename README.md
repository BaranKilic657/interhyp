# 🏡 Future Home Twin

**Your Personal GPS to Homeownership — Powered by Real Properties, Real Financing & Real Life Choices.**

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Future Home Twin** is an interactive digital experience that helps people turn the vague dream of owning a home into a clear, navigable, and emotionally meaningful journey.

Most people don't know:

- **What can I afford?**
- **What affects my future equity?**
- **What life decisions actually matter?**
- **When will I truly be ready to buy?**
- **Where should I live — and what's realistic?**

This project transforms these difficult questions into a guided, playful, future-facing journey powered by:

- 🏘️ **Property Listings API**
- 💰 **Financing Simulation API**
- 📅 **Interactive Timeline & Life Sandbox**
- 🤖 **AI Chat Companion**
- ☎️ **Optional AI Phone Concierge**

## 🚧 The Core Problem

Owning your own home is one of life's biggest milestones — but the path to get there is **confusing**, **stressful**, and **emotionally draining**.

Users face:

- ❓ Uncertainty about equity
- 💼 Doubts about income stability
- 😰 Fear that they will "never catch up"
- 📋 Confusing financing rules
- 🔮 A lack of visibility into how life decisions impact future affordability
- 📈 A painful market where interest rates, prices, and supply change constantly
- 📚 Information overload
- 🧊 Analysis paralysis

Interhyp's customers, especially **30–45 year olds** and **young families**, feel stuck in a fog.

✅ **Emotionally supportive**

## 🚀 The Solution: Your Future Home Twin

Meet the center of the experience — a **personalized**, **evolving digital version of you** that represents:

- 👤 Who you can become
- 🏠 The home you could live in
- 🛤️ The life decisions that lead you there

Your **Future Home Twin** uses your inputs + real market data + simulation to show:

✔️ What home you can likely afford — and when  
✔️ How your equity evolves over time  
✔️ How life changes (job, city, kids, partner, break, promotion) shift your timeline  
✔️ What areas & properties fit your realistic budget  
✔️ What steps get you closer fastest  
✔️ What you control — and what you can't  

**It's Google Maps for your financial future.**
